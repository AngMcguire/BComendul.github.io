      <h1>Quick Biography</h1>
      <div>I graduated of the University of Connecticut with a B.S in Environmental Science and Resource Economics in 2016. After graduation, I accumulated over three years of professional work experience with Power Home Remodeling in Wilton, CT. During my tenure I received multiple promotions with progressively increasing performance expectations and supervisory responsibilities. I moved from Connecticut to San Diego in February of 2020. During the subsequent quarantine period, I passed the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam and learned multiple programming languages in order to enhance my skillset in computational analytics.</div>
      <div>Quarantine started at about the same time I moved in to my new apartment. Jobs and interviews were scarce to come by so I decided to use the time to expand my skillsets and knowledge. I first started with Computer Science courses on EDx, an online learning platform, in order to get a fundamental understanding of Computer Science from an accomplished professor. MITx Computer Science in Python 1 & 2 taught by John Guttag were the first two courses I took and they were extremely well designed. After completion, I furthered my knowledge in Python with a Data Science couse taught by UCSDx which introduced me to Jupityr Notebooks (among many other things). Additionally, I recieved certifications for completing Data Science: R by Harvardx which allowed me to expand into using R and introduced me to additional machine learning algorithms. From there, I was able to use R and Python in order to perform a multitude of analytical algorithms. My projects primarily relied upon large stock market data sets taken from Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.com. </div>
      <div>In my work I noticed an ongoing weakness related to Object oriented programming. This method of programming wasn't necessary for most analytical work, however, it was a weakness that I felt I should improve upon. I began to research and learn Java, a strictly typed programming language, which relies on object oriented programming by default. I found this language extremely enjoyable to write in for some reason and it is now my most used language. I have created a range of programs using Java, ranging from solutions to complex theoretical math problem to a Minesweeper solving algorithm- what a throwback! The experience growing muli-faceted onject oriented programs was extremely beneficial to my overall programming skillset and I believe this experience learning different languages has made it easier and easier to learn new ones like Javascript, HTML, and MySQL. </div>
      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <div>Links on the sidebar can be used to navigate to some of my completed projects. These projects were selected to demonstrate particular skills or algorithms that are both practical and efficient. All of the projects were written by myself in a variety of languages and use datasets collected from the internet or pseudo-randomized ones. These are just a few of the projects I have done which incorporate some useful algorithms and visuals. </div>
      <div> Fourth Down analysis was done in Python and uses multiple monte carlo experiments in order to make box-plots with the data. Monte-Carlo experiments are a broad category of programs that take lots of random samples from a large dataset in order to find mean and variation. This technique allows for easy visualization of the average outcome as well as the variability of outcomes and it forces your data into a "normal" distribution. This type of analysis is basic but extremely effective for understanding and visualizing data.  </div>
      <div> K-means Clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm designed to group data points into sensible groups. The demo was designed in a way to maximize understanding of the algorithm behind it. The example is very basic but it illustrates the idea of the algorithm. This tool is used to group large quantities of data into sensible groups so that you can do further analysis.</div>
      <div> Naive Bayes algorithm is a supervised algorithm that requires "training" and the use of Bayes statistical theory. This type of program allows us to predict outcomes based on historical information. The example used in the demonstration walks through how hypothetical bank loans could be automatically approved/denied by using historical data. The program "trains" by evaluating the probability of an outcome occuring given each prior event independently. Afterwards, when it is given new data it can produce probabilities of outcomes based on the prior events. </div>
